# 2D-Turn-Based-Game
Unity project inspired by the turn-based combat gameplay from Persona 4. This repository only includes the scripts that were made for this project.

## About the project
This is a small videogame project where the main objective is to navigate through an entire small level. Here, the player will have to face-off multiple different enemies with turn-based combat. 

A lot of the assets used for this project were extracted directly from different Free Assets available online. The main character sprites, animations, voice lines, and music, were extracted from Persona 4, and Persona 4 Arena Ultimax.

## Important Note
The documents displayed in here do not represent the project as a whole, making it impossible to replicate the whole game without having to use your own assets and design of the Unity scenes as a whole. The only things available for public view in this project are the scripts utilised for most of the game logic. This includes a state machine that controls the combat system as a whole (*BattleSystem.cs*), GameObject scripts with their respective data and actions (*Player.cs*, *Enemy.cs*, *PlayerParty.cs*, etc.), and several Utility and UI Scripts for the game (*DungeonUI.cs*, *MenuAnimControl.cs*, *DamageIcon.cs*, etc.).

## Gameplay showcase
Because it's not possible to replicate the game with only scripts, I recorded a gameplay showcase of the whole game in YouTube. Here's the link if anyone is interested in seeing the final result:
